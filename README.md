# Learn R


This R project was created to store the `Learning R` - Barton Poulson - LinkedIn Learning. This R project included:  


## 1. CODE  

- R scripts with structure of __*chapter_lesson_titleoflesson.R*__; for instance, 02_12_Importing Data from Spreadsheet.R  

## 2. DATA  

- External data files.  
- Otherwise, we can refer to several datasets from the `datasets` package that is part of R, so those datasets are not included here.  

## 3. OUTPUT  

- The output folder contains any images or other exportable files that result from the analyses. The images are generally saved in either PNG format or PDF format.
